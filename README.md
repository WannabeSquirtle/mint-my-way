# mint-my-way
Hate how Mint displays your transactions, budgets, spending? So do I. Let's change that.

Mint allows you to download transactions. It gives you a good amount of data such as cost, date, and even what account the transaction was under. Mint is a great aggregator. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much beyond that. I find budgets to be useless, very little in the form of visual display, and nothing that makes me want to diligently use it. But what do you expect from something that's free...?

I will continue to use mint as an aggregator but I will redesign how that data is used.

Better budgeting.
Better visuals.
Better staying power.

This application will be a Spring Boot application with an Oracle database hosted locally (although eventually, they could be moved to the cloud). An angular front end will be the UI that will communicate to a REST api in the Spring Boot application.

Wish me luck!
